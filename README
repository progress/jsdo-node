This node server takes data stored in a MongoDB and exposes it under the jsdo protocol. The serviceURI is http://nodejsdo-21944.onmodulus.net and the catalogURI is http://nodejsdo-21944.onmodulus.net/catalogURI. This project also contains a node server instance in the jsdoTester directory that tests the server to make sure it works properly. This can be viewed at http://angulardemo-21580.onmodulus.net/test. This data is also table-formatted using angular.js at http://statictest-21670.onmodulus.net.
