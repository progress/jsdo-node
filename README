### Project Description
This project centers around a node server that takes data stored in a MongoDB and exposes it under the jsdo protocol. The serviceURI is http://nodejsdo-21944.onmodulus.net and the catalogURI is http://nodejsdo-21944.onmodulus.net/catalogURI. Each database requires a catalog that describes the properties of each data point and the functions available for manipulating the data. This project also contains a node file that tests the server to make sure it works properly. This can be viewed at http://angulardemo-21580.onmodulus.net/test. This data is also table-formatted using angular.js at http://statictest-21670.onmodulus.net.
